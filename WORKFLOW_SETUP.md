# GitHub Actions Workflow Setup

## Issue
The GitHub Actions workflow file (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`) couldn't be pushed because your Personal Access Token doesn't have the `workflow` scope.

## Solution

### Option 1: Create New Token with Workflow Scope
1. Go to [GitHub Settings > Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)
2. Click "Generate new token" → "Generate new token (classic)"
3. **Name**: `Smart Task Manager - Full Access`
4. **Scopes**: Select both:
   - ✅ `repo` (Full control of private repositories)
   - ✅ `workflow` (Update GitHub Action workflows)
5. Copy the new token
6. Run: `git remote set-url origin https://NEW_TOKEN@github.com/AITEST9999/Smarttaskai.git`
7. Push the workflow: `git add .github/workflows/ci.yml && git commit -m "Add CI/CD workflow" && git push`

### Option 2: Add Workflow via GitHub Web Interface
1. Go to your repository: [https://github.com/AITEST9999/Smarttaskai](https://github.com/AITEST9999/Smarttaskai)
2. Click "Actions" tab
3. Click "set up a workflow yourself"
4. Copy the content from `ci.yml` in this folder
5. Commit directly via GitHub web interface

## Workflow Features
The CI/CD pipeline includes:
- ✅ Automated testing (backend + frontend)
- ✅ Code linting and type checking
- ✅ Security scanning with Snyk
- ✅ Docker image building
- ✅ Automated deployment to production
- ✅ Slack notifications

## Current Status
- ✅ All infrastructure files pushed to GitHub
- ⏸️ GitHub Actions workflow pending (needs workflow scope)
- ✅ Ready to continue with backend development

## Next Steps
1. Add the workflow (using one of the options above)
2. Continue with **Phase 1 Task P1-002: Backend Core Setup**
